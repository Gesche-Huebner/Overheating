# Overheating

The data from the UK and the US were largely analyzed separately; hence, there are two R files, called 
•	Overheating_Analysis_UK
•	Overheating_Analysis_US

They are linked in
•	compare_UK_US
•	Plot_data_UK_US

The data are here:
Huebner, Gesche (2022): Data set: Overheating concern in parents and non-parents. University College London. Dataset. https://doi.org/10.5522/04/19294289.v1 

These are the pilot data: Detailedsummaryreport_21_08_05_21_04_01_720_rawdata.zip

These are the sample size calculations: SampleSize_Overheating.R
